# TE-12-23-CLOCK

## TEC CLOCK
This program will allow the TEC to be used as a CLOCK. The display is used as the readout and the time can be set as shown opposite. This is a 24 hour clock and its accuracy depends on the setting of the SPEED CONTROL. In a future issue we will present a crystal oscillator to take the place of the 4049 to turn the TEC into an accurate time-piece.

## To set CLOCK:
at 989: insert seconds
at 98a: insert minutes
at 98B: insert hours
Example: 7:45:32
989: 32 98A: 45 98B:07

So... Has anyone ever fixed the Clock listing? I’ve typed it in and double checked all entries and I have it exactly as printed... But it doesn’t work... Can someone tell me where the error is?
